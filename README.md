####UPDATE DATABASE AND SERVER CONNECTIONS
This project does not require a database with persistent data. For development we used local databases on each developer's computer to avoid having database errors that could hinder other developers' work. Simply running mongod should start an empty database which can then be populated with users and projects from the website.
